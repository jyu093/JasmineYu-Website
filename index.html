        <p class="lead mb-4">I chose to be a Biology major because I am really passionate about healthcare and empowering others to improve their health. As an undergraduate, I am involved in UCRâ€™s Mini Medical School (MMS) where I volunteer in the community to provide health education for preventative diseases like diabetes and hypertension. When presenting with my group, I make sure to keep community members engaged by using analogies and avoiding complicated language. We have a demonstration on how to use a blood measure cuff and ask interactive questions such as how each community member can improve their diet or physical activity. As a board member in MMS, I have the opportunity to train other members on how to present and be involved in the community. Volunteering in medically underserved communities has allowed me to learn how to connect and communicate with patients in ways that they can understand easily. In addition, I participated in UCRâ€™s Future Physician Leaders program over the summer where I had the opportunity to interact with community members in underserved areas, and collect data through surveys to gain a better understanding of relevant information to make presenting more efficient. Over the summer, I volunteered on medical missions in developing countries. I worked alongside a team of physicians and nurses to provide free medical aid such as tetanus vaccines and dental care. Many of the locals we serve come from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds and do not have access to adequate health care or cannot afford to see a physician. <br><br>

        In the Riverside community, I volunteer at Riverside Free Clinic. Here, we provide free services such as medical screening, counseling, and educational classes. Volunteering at Riverside Free Clinic has taught me the importance of providing comprehensive care for patients. I am part of the NeedyMeds committee where we prepare and distribute first aid, flu, and allergy kits for our patients. In addition to the kits, we work with patients to find programs that can supply them with the medication they need at a reduced cost or even free. As an aspiring physician, I see this as a foundation to good bedside manners, and I am eager to continue to learn more.<br><br>

        My involvement in the Inland Empire and my time on medical missions has helped me gain first-hand experience serving medically underserved areas. Being a Biology major helps me progress towards my career goal of being a physician that educates and gives back to the community. Next year, I will be a medical student at UCRâ€™s School of Medicine, and I hope to become a physician that continues to serve the underserved.
